# Flower Image Classifier
Second project from Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program.

I built an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. I used this dataset from Oxford of 102 flower categories. The final product is an application that can be trained on any set of labelled images. In this specific case, the network is learning about flowers and end up as a command-line application, but it can be easily modified to classify any type of image based on a labelled dataset of images.
